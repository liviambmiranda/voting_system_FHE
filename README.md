**Blockchain-based Voting System for Collective Decision-Making in Inter-organizational Collaboration**

This project refers to a blockchain-based voting system for collective decision-making in inter-organizational collaboration. The system utilizes a combination of privacy-preserving smart contract with Fully Homomorphic Encryption, tokenization and Proof-of-Stake protocol policies.

This repository contains the implementations of the contracts for the blockchain-based voting system, descriptions and steps for execution. The scripts and steps used to perform the transaction tests were also made available.

- The proof-of concept implementation of the system is based on the local and non-local test networks provided by Zama in [fhevm](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm).

- The smart contract is implemented in Solidity programming language. Please visit [Voting Smart Contract](https://github.com/liviambmiranda/voting_system_FHE/blob/main/Contract/Voting_Smart_Contract.sol).
